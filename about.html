                        <h2>A Leader in Digital Innovation</h2>
                        <p>With an extensive two-decade career as a project management and technology leader, I possess a demonstrable history of fostering innovation, streamlining operational processes, and leading multi-disciplinary teams to achieve strategic objectives. I approach every opportunity with a blend of vision, discipline, and collaborative energy. My passion lies in streamlining complex organizational ecosystems into efficient, insight-generating platforms that serve both operational and executive needs.</p>
                        <p>As a trusted advisor and subject matter expert, I have successfully guided organizations through digital transformations by leveraging deep technical knowledge and expertise in strategic planning, design, and implementation of emerging technologies. My work has consistently focused on aligning mission-critical initiatives with long-term business objectives.</p>

                        <h2>Early Career & Education</h2>
                        <p>My foundational experience includes impactful roles that shaped my analytical and technical skills. As a Research Associate at Howard University, I led laboratory research to develop novel environmental remediation processes for $Cr(VI)$ and TCE contamination. At MedImmune, Inc., I facilitated clinical production data management for monoclonal antibody therapies within a highly FDA-regulated environment.</p>
                        <p>I hold a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering from Howard University and a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of South Alabama.</p>
